1,Big Whiskey’s Concepts Announces Herschend as Chief Executive Officer,"Springfield, MO. September 1, 2015 — Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar started in 2006 and quickly became a local favorite. Over the last 9 years they have opened 5 locations in 3 cities. They now have two major focuses, to continue expansion of company owned stores, and to establish the franchise side of their business as a nationwide brand. In order to achieve those goals, Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar is proud to announce the hiring of Austin Herschend as Chief Executive Officer of Big Whiskey’s Franchising.

Austin Herschend, originally from Branson Missouri and a University of Missouri alum, has spent time working in finance at Putnam Investments in Boston, MA. He later moved back to the Ozarks to focus on his family and become more involved in his family’s business, Herschend Family Entertainment. His family’s business started over 50 years ago with Silver Dollar City and now owns and operates 26 locations in 10 states. Herschend Family Entertainment is now the largest family-owned themed attractions corporation.

“Austin has had an ownership stake in Big Whiskey’s since 2013, and has been serving in an ownership advisory role. With his background in finance and involvement in Herschend Family Entertainment, this is the perfect marriage to expand the franchise side of our company. Austin has a great passion for our brand and has been a fresh set of eyes for future possibilities.” said Big Whiskey’s Owner, Paul Sundy.

“Big Whiskey’s is positioned to have a meaningful expansion and I am excited to be one of the driving forces behind Big Whiskey’s Franchising. I am thrilled to move from a passive role into becoming the CEO for Big Whiskey’s Franchising. Over the last few weeks we have had a substantial amount of qualified leads in 6 different states. Our community embraces Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar and we are excited to see our passion and tradition spread across the nation.” said Austin Herschend.

Big Whiskey’s Franchising has hired Franchise Dynamics, the largest national franchise development company, to partner with them on the sales side of the franchise business. “The ownership group wanted to make sure we put our best foot forward. After interviewing four franchise sales companies, Franchise Dynamics was the best fit. We now have franchise opportunities in 31 states.” says Herschend.",https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BWsign.jpg|https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_3536.jpg|https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAOIAAAAJGEyZDM0OTgzLWZkZTgtNDk3Ny05ZWI0LTNmMWIyNjZkYmQ2YQ.jpg,2015-08-23,Uncategorized
1136,SGF Chain Plans Major Expansion,"Big Whiskey's is about to go national.

A month ago, the Big Whiskey's American Bar & Grill brand expanded to Branson Landing, its fifth Ozarks location. But now, the ownership quintet declares that the region and the rest of the country is a potential home for up to 100 Big Whiskey's franchises.

""We are hiring for all positions and for managers,"" co-owner Paul Sundy said. ""We are kind of in the middle of our expansion plans over the next year to seven years. Our goal is to really blow this thing wide open.""

The plan?

•To open a restaurant in the St. Robert/Waynesville area in the next six months.

•To find a workable piece of property for a location in Joplin. 

•To complete a pair of three-store deals in Arkansas currently in the works.

Sundy also said there are inquiries in Texas, and the company is studying how best to enter the Kansas City market with at least four locations.

In recent months, Big Whiskey's Concepts acquired Sundy's former company, English Management. Owned with Mike Heslin, English Management operated Springfield-based brands such as Parlor 88 Lounge & Eatery, Dublin's Pass and Opus Cigar Bar.

""We sold all the interests that we were in with other restaurant concepts and brought our focus in to one brand, Big Whiskey's American Bar & Restaurant,"" Sundy said. ""We've merged all our infrastructure to put our best foot forward for our corporate stores, and work with franchisees.""

Now that Sundy's focus is mainly on Big Whiskey's, owning partners include Heslin, Jameson Clark, Randy Gildehaus and Austin Herschend.

Why shed multiple brands? Largely, time management.

""We opened nine different concepts over the last 10 years,"" Sundy said. ""One concept hasn't gotten my undivided attention.""

Sundy said among all his restaurant and bar brands, Big Whiskey's was the one most poised for fast growth, with ""bigger"" selling points for a broad audience including groups as varied as businesspeople in suits, sports fans wanting to catch a game at the pub and families out to dinner.

""This concept was the one that was farthest down the road,"" Sundy said. ""It had gotten over a lot of startup hurdles.""

After a year of legwork, Big Whiskey's launched its franchise business last month, hiring two Chicago-area companies to assist. iFranchise Group consulted on packaging franchise deals and making legal preparations. Another company, Franchise Dynamics, assists with actual sales.

""Right now we can legally sell in 38 states,"" Sundy said. ""Our goal in the next seven years is to have 100 franchises sold.""

Much depends on how sales go in the first couple years, Sundy said.

As Big Whiskey's enters the national stage, it's made some tweaks:

• Big Whiskey's now has its own whiskey brand, Bootleg Bourbon. ""We're not trying to be a full-on whiskey bar, but we're definitely standing behind our whiskey product,"" Sundy said.

• The ""all-purpose sauce"" slathered on Big Whiskey's chicken wings will be sold by the pint and in to-go containers. ""We want to make a retail market out of that.""

• The latest menu adds a few heart-healthy appetizers and more fish dishes. ""We've really focused our energy on entree side of our biz,"" Sundy said.

""We still believe in the four-opportunities approach,"" Sundy said, referring to a marketing strategy he's used since the mid-2000s. ""Lunch, happy hour, dinner and late night.""

2133,"Big Whiskey’s Coming to Bentonville, Arkansas","Springfield, MO. February 2nd, 2016 – Big Whiskey’s Franchising is excited to add Bentonville, AR, businessman Shane Miller to the Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar family. Along with his wife, Candice, and 8 month old daughter, Olson, Mr. Miller has lived and worked in Bentonville since 2008. With a strong background in real estate and franchise restaurant development, he is the perfect person to open the company’s first Arkansas location.

“I’ve been a fan of Big Whiskey’s ever since the first location opened and have known for a long time that we needed one in Bentonville. I’m excited that I’ll be able to make Big Whiskey’s a part of this community.” Miller said.

Austin Herschend, Big Whiskey’s Franchising CEO, said, “Shane and his wife will be a great addition to the Big Whiskey’s family. His enthusiasm and passion for his community coupled with his background in business are exactly what we have been looking for.”

Big Whiskey’s Franchising has been interested in Northwest Arkansas for several years because of the strong economic base and potential for multiple locations. The company is confident Bentonville is the right town to enter the Arkansas market. Miller is working to finalize the location for his first restaurant now and hopes to have it open by the fall of 2016.

 
About Big Whiskey’s: Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar was started in Springfield, MO in 2006 and quickly became a local favorite. Over the next ten years, the company opened five corporate locations in three cities. Big Whiskey’s Franchising was formed in 2015 with the help of Franchise Dynamics, the largest franchise development firm in the United States. The company now has two major focuses: continued expansion of company owned stores in Missouri and becoming a nationwide brand via franchise growth.

2136,"Big Whiskey's adds new franchise, bottles own BBQ sauce","Springfield-based Big Whiskey's American Restaurant & Bar will expand into Bentonville, Arkansas with a new franchise store, the company announced Monday.

""If everything goes right, we’re looking at (opening) September of this year,"" said Paul Sundy, chief operating officer.

The Bentonville franchisee is Shane Miller, a business owner with a background in real estate.

Big Whiskey's opened in 2006 with a location at 311 Park Central East. In the 10 years since, the company has opened four additional locations, in south Springfield, east Springfield, Ozark — and, in May 2015, Branson.

The Bentonville franchise store would be the fifth. The menu and beverages will be largely the same. ""The look will emulate the Branson store a lot,"" Sundy said.

Sundy said the company is eyeing the Kansas City market for its next round of expansion, hoping to seed the market with corporate-owned stores, then franchises. The goal is to open three new Big Whiskey's pubs in Kansas City over the next two years.

Meanwhile, Big Whiskey’s All-Purpose BBQ Sauce — a honey-whiskey flavor condiment the restaurant uses for its wings, burgers and pork chops — went on sale for $3.99 per bottle at the Springfield Hy-Vee store Feb. 6.

""It's in its infancy stage,"" Sundy said. Big Whiskey's is looking to distribute All-Purpose BBQ to other stores.

When asked Monday if it sold well over Super Bowl Sunday, Sundy said he didn't know yet. ""But our guy’s back in (Hy-Vee) today to restock.""

""That's a good sign.""

2140,'The Best Wings Ever' Coming to Bentonville,"A new restaurant-slash-bar is making its way to Bentonville, and according to sources, it’s bringing “the best wings ever” with it.

The eatery is Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar, a Springfield, Missouri,-based franchise that boasts a casual neighborhood restaurant/bar vibe. Shane Miller, a Springfield native who moved to Bentonville in 2008 to work for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., is the local franchisee who will open the company’s first Arkansas location.

Miller expects the restaurant to open in Bentonville this fall. A preliminary site plan shows the building being built along Southeast Walton Boulevard across the street from the Four Points by Sheraton Bentonville.

The site, adjacent to Guess Who liquor store, is owned by Roger Gildehaus.

Miller, whose position for Walmart for the past three years has involved dealing with the food services spaces at the front of the retailer’s stores, says during that time he’s learned a great deal about the restaurant business.

And all the while, he has been missing Big Whiskey’s, a place he enjoyed for years while living in downtown Springfield.

“I kept thinking, ‘Someone really needs to open a Big Whiskey’s ,’” he said. “And then it hit me that that someone could be me.”

To that end, for the past two years Miller and his wife, Candice, have been working with the company, which, for its part, has been working to expand its franchising business nationally.

“Shane and Candice will be a great addition to the Big Whiskey’s family,” Austin Herschend, Big Whiskey’s franchising CEO, said in a company news release. “His enthusiasm and passion for his community, coupled with his background in business, are exactly what we have been looking for.”

Miller says one of the things that has always drawn him to the restaurant is that although it’s mainly an eatery — with approximately 70 percent of sales coming from food — it manages to incorporate a fun-bar vibe throughout. But, he added, it’s a kid-friendly establishment.

Big Whiskey’s was founded in 2006 and has since opened five corporate locations in three Missouri cities.

A Big Whiskey's location opened in downtown Little Rock in 2008, but a company spokesman said that location operates under a licensing agreement, and the only affiliation is the restaurant name.

2149,BW Plans Kansas City Expansion,"Springfield, Mo.’s Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar is coming to Kansas City.

Big Whiskey’s plans eight or nine locations, including three corporate-owned operations to “seed the market.” Three locations are expected to open in the next two years and it is looking at locations that are around 5,500-to-6,500 square feet.

Menu items include Buffalo chicken dip, smothered steak (USDA choice center cut, seasoned sirloin with grilled onions, mushrooms and melted mozzarella cheese), lemon pepper chicken, jerk chops, fish tacos, pan-seared tilapia, chicken ranch Alfredo pasta, and barbecue pork chops.

It also offers classic cocktails and frozen cocktails, wine and beer, and seasonal specialty cocktails like the current Black Walnut Old Fashioned.

Partner Paul Sundy said he named the restaurants after a longtime customer of his grandfather’s tavern in Lockwood, Mo.

The regular would come in a couple of times a week at happy hour with the same drink order, “I’m only going to have one, so make it a big one,” earning him the nickname Big Whiskey.

Sundy has four other partners in Big Whiskey’s Concepts, which owns five restaurants — three in Springfield, and two in the Ozark area. They launched Big Whiskey’s Franchising LLC four months ago and their first franchisee plans a Bentonville, Ark. location.

2237,Big Whiskey’s Signs Franchisee for Kansas City,"Big Whiskey’s Franchising has announced the signing of its newest franchisee in Kansas City.  H2B Restaurants recently secured the rights to open the first Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar franchise in the Kansas City, Missouri, metro area.

H2B, a Missouri-based restaurant group owned by Ed House, Ryan Bohl, and J.D. House, had been considering the venture for some time.  “We’ve followed the growth of Big Whiskey’s for years and we’re excited to now be part of that expansion,” says Ed House, H2B’s managing partner.  “When we learned the Kansas City franchise was available, we knew it would be the perfect market for our first Big Whiskey’s.”

Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar currently operates three restaurants in Springfield, Missouri, plus one each in Ozark and Branson, Missouri, and will open its first franchise location in Bentonville, Arkansas, later this year.  The first Big Whiskey’s was started in downtown Springfield in 2006, and the brand began franchising in late 2015.

“We’re pleased to have Ed, Ryan, and J.D. as the newest members of the Big Whiskey’s family,” says Austin Herschend, the company’s franchising CEO. “We’ve been impressed with H2B’s multi-unit business experience. They will be a superb addition to the Big Whiskey’s brand.” He added that the parent company will also open its first corporate-owned restaurant in Kansas City “around the same time that H2B will open their store, so we can maximize our impact in the market.”  Herschend predicated both units will open in early 2017 and intends to open up to eight restaurants in the market. “We’re aggressively looking for more opportunities in Kansas City.”

Both H2B and Big Whiskey’s are working closely together to find ideal sites “that complement each other but don’t compete,” House explains.  “Opening two Big Whiskey’s almost simultaneously will give us a tremendous advantage in Kansas City.”",https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bigwhiskey_branson_patio382.jpg,2016-04-26,Featured|Franchise|News|Opening

2269,Big Whiskey's Donates $5000,"Springfield MO-- Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar has, for 10 years, supported a number of local charitable causes.  For the last 3 years, the company has raised funds for Ambassadors for Childrens but this year was special.

During the month of May, all 5 Big Whiskey’s locations held contests and special events as well as individual employees who committed their time & effort with the result being an incredible donation of $5000.

Ambassadors for Children is a cause-related subsidiary of the Council of Churches of the Ozarks that is a foster parent recruitment agency serving Greene, Christian and Taney Counties.  “We’re so humbled by the generosity of the good people at Big Whiskey’s”, said Denee Fay, agency director.  “They not only greatly exceeded our expectations with this donation but it was all they did to help raise awareness of our cause.”

Anna Wilcox of Big Whiskey’s was equally proud of her staff and management’s commitment to the fund drive. “Last year we raised $1600 for Ambassadors for Children so we’re pretty excited to have increased our donation by this much,” she explained.

Big Whiskey’s Ozark restaurant raised the most money of the five stores and staffers Laria Tittor and Tritton Barnes were tops in individual donation commitments.  “We have a strong sense of community here at Big Whiskey’s and this particular group is near and dear to our hearts,” said Paul Sundy, Big Whiskey’s Senior Vice President of Operations.

Fay explained that the donation would go a long way in helping local foster families supplement the limited income they receive from the state to care for children in their home. “Our foster parents will be able to do so much more for their kids with the help from Big Whiskey’s—we’re truly blessed with this donation.”",https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/AFC-1-1.jpg|https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/AFC.jpg|https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/AFC-1.jpg,2016-06-20,News

For the fourth year, each of the Big Whiskey’s Springfield area restaurants sponsored Angel Trees. Customers were invited to participate at the end of their meal by purchasing an ornament for the Angel Tree, which goes directly to helping families in each stores area. Different color ornaments mean different size donations, and the colorfully-decorated trees raised more than $2,000!

Big Whiskey’s on Battlefield Road held a free all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast. “Pancakes with Santa” was open to the public and a chance for all kids to meet and have their photo made with Santa. There was also a surprise visit by the Cocoa Cola Polar Bear much to the delight of all the kids. BW guests were asked to leave any size donation to help the adopted families, and those donations came to more than $1,000!

BW co-owner Jameson Clark personally donated $1,000, giving them more than $4,000 to buy the gifts on the family’s wish lists. “We’re excited to be able to fill all the wishes of our adopted families,” said Clark. “It feels good to know that our own family of employees care enough to adopt real families in need. They did all this – the idea, the effort of putting these together and working on their own time, plus actually purchasing the gifts on all the lists and gift wrapping them all. It was a labor of love and we’re really proud of them.”

After all the wishes on every list were checked off, BW had $400 left over and made it a donation to Ambassadors for Children, a local non-profit agency that works to support foster home care.",https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Santa-Coke-Polar-Bear.jpg|https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wingapalooza-Team-BW.jpg|https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wrapping-gifts-for-adopted-families.jpg,2017-01-16,Events|News

The restaurant franchise continues to expand with the purchase of a new location, turning a former Ruby Tuesday into a new Big Whiskey’s restaurant and bar.

Paul Sundy, co-founder of Big Whiskey’s, announced, “We are excited to be part of the Republic community. Finally, our guests who live and work there will have a Big Whiskey’s of their own.”

6902,Big Whiskey’s Flagship Location Celebrates 11 Years!,"July 3, 2017, Springfield MO-- A legend on its own, Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar® celebrates 11 years in business with mouth-watering classics and new locations on the horizon.

What started as a dream to recreate the “little corner tavern,” Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar has grown well beyond its roots on Park Central in downtown Springfield, Missouri. When the doors opened to the flagship location on July 4, 2006, the owners had no idea where the legend of Big Whiskey would take them.

“We were best friends, had been working together at other restaurants, and thought, ‘we can do this,’” states Founder and Senior Vice President of Operations, Paul Sundy, about crafting the original Big Whiskey’s concept with co-founders, Mike Heslin and Randy Gildehaus.

Sundy continues, ""We wanted to create a great restaurant with a celebrated bar product, and we've come a long way towards staying true to that goal.""

It’s been a fun, crazy ride over the past 11 years with the expansion of four additional corporate-owned Big Whiskey’s locations; two in Springfield, MO, one in Ozark, MO, and one in Branson, MO.

In 2015, the company began drafting plans for franchise opportunities and have recently opened their first two franchises in Bentonville, AR and Lee’s Summit, MO. A sixth corporate Big Whiskey’s is slated to open in Republic, MO in August 2017 ahead of a Las Vegas franchise-owned location in 2018.

Friendly service, a community spirit, and consistent, delicious food have paved the way for the company’s continued success. “We’ve never wavered on our commitment to a quality product and outstanding service, and that’s really our foundation that we pride ourselves on,” Sundy said.

On the current Big Whiskey’s menu the brand pays tribute to the little tavern on Park Central and their continued journey with featured “Park Central Classics,” Caribbean Jerk Chops, Classic Fish and Chips, BW Chicken Tenders, BBQ Pork Choppers, and Baby Back Ribs. Stop in and say hello, enjoy a great meal, and share a toast to 11 years and counting!

The newest Big Whiskey's location boasts a few ""first-times"" for the 11-year old restaurant brand. In February of this year, the ownership group jumped at the chance to purchase the shuttered Ruby Tuesday's location just off of Highway 60 in Republic. This unique piece of real estate provided the brand their first opportunity at opening a stand-alone Big Whiskey's location. The Republic opening will also be the first corporate-owned store the company has opened since successfully launching their first two franchise locations earlier this year; Bentonville, AR, in March and Lee's Summit, MO, in May.

Sundy continues, ""We've been very fortunate at securing great locations for Big Whiskey's, all within shopping and business centers. The Republic store is a great opportunity for us to get our feet wet with a slightly updated design and layout in a detached location.""
Big Whiskey's will celebrate their Republic Grand Opening beginning Friday, August 18 through Sunday, August 20.
 

The official opening ceremony takes place Saturday, August 19th at approximately 10:40am in the parking lot of the restaurant. Members of the Republic Area Chamber of Commerce will be on-site to host the official ribbon cutting. Following the ceremony, doors will open for business at 11:00am.

Part of the ceremony on Saturday morning will also include the opportunity for guests to receive a Big Whiskey's coupon book, offering one $25.00 gift certificate for each month from September 1, 2017 to August 31, 2018. The first 100 guests to enter on Saturday will receive the complimentary book valued at $300.00.

Laura Head Elliott, Director of Marketing states, “We were able to test the coupon book promotion at the Lee's Summit franchise location, and it was a huge hit! It's such a great way to engage and give back to the community from day one.""

The ribbon cutting ceremony concluded a week of final staff training, community engagement and a social media blitz. On-site to help with opening ceremonies were members of the Republic Area Chamber of Commerce, local community officials and company team members, including Matt Caetano, Vice President of Operations.

Prior to opening the second Big Whiskey’s location in Springfield in 2010, the BW team implemented a series of opening week events that has continued as the model for each store opening since. Both a “Friends and Family” night, followed by a Sneak Peek party are hosted, welcoming staff families, community leaders, building contractors, vendors, and others closely involved in assisting with opening preparations.

“It’s our own version of a soft-opening,” explains Matt Caetano. “We can’t think of better way to help train and prepare our staff than allowing them to serve and test their skills on the people closest to them.”

We offered a small token of complimentary dinner to anyone that might find themselves evacuating to southwest Missouri,” states Director of Marketing, Laura Head Elliott. “It wasn’t much, but we knew right away we wanted to help.”

While watching the rain continue to pour over the Texas Gulf Coast, in record amounts, Big Whiskey’s staff and managers began to come forward wanting to do something, anything, to help victims. After brainstorming ideas, the marketing team reached out to Springfield-based Convoy of Hope to launch a coordinated fundraising campaign.

Convoy of Hope is a faith-based, nonprofit organization with a driving passion to feed the world through children’s feeding initiatives, community outreaches and disaster response. They had previously stationed their team in San Antonio ahead of the storm to jumpstart relief efforts as quickly as possible.

“We are incredibly thankful for Big Whiskey’s partnership,” says Hal Donaldson, president of Convoy of Hope. “This campaign will enable us to help even more storm survivors in need.”

Elliott continues, “The work that Convoy of Hope does is truly remarkable. Big Whiskey’s has always tried to support community organizations, and the fact that they are based right here in Springfield – it seemed like the perfect way for us to help with Hurricane Harvey relief.”

 
HOW YOU CAN SUPPORT HURRICANE RELIEF WITH BIG WHISKEY'S & CONVOY OF HOPE
Beginning Friday, September 1st, guests at all Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar locations will have the opportunity to add a non-taxable donation to their ticket in any amount. To incentivize giving, Big Whiskey’s will also offer a Free Appetizer coupon card, valued at $8.99, for every donation to Convoy of Hope $10.00 and above. Each restaurant location has also committed $500.00 to help jump start giving, and guest donations can be made with cash or credit card.

Vice President of Operations, Matt Caetano, states “There’s definitely a huge need for financial support for the relief efforts that Convoy of Hope is leading in Texas. Since we don’t yet have a Big Whiskey’s in Texas, this is the next best thing we can do to help out.”

8603,Fall Inspired Drinks Land at Big Whiskey's,"Tastes Like Fall


Pumpkin Spice? (Insert “thumbs down” emoji.) Big Whiskey’s is bucking the oh-so-popular trend with three new Fall-inspired treats…the boozy kind, not the caffeinated latte kind!

“Fall is this crazy time of year where seasonal flavors and scents take center stage. Social media has definitely heightened the frenzy, so we’re jumping on the bandwagon with our own autumn flavored cocktails,” explains Laura Head Elliott, Director of Marketing.

Three new cocktails offer something for a wide range of demographics and spirit drinkers. The Golden Orchard Martini plays up the crisp, seasonal sweetness of apples and pears, combining Skyy Pear vodka with Angry Orchard Hard Apple Cider.

Taking a stab at the uber trendy beer cocktails, the Harvest Beer truly does taste like fall. A combination of Mother’s Oktoberfest Lager with a shot of Jack Daniels Honey Whiskey (and a splash of our secret ingredient) served over ice, make this a refreshing drink and very approachable for those uncertain whiskey drinkers.

Lastly, Big Whiskey’s has turned the popular Moscow Mule into a new fall must-have drink by reinventing the flavor combination. The Apple Cider Irish Mule combines Jameson Irish Whiskey, apple cider, ginger beer, and a dash of cinnamon to create a match made in a pile of freshly raked fall leaves!
BIG WHISKEY’S AIMS TO OFFER WHISKEY FOR EVERYONE.
With the development of Limited Time Offer menus and drink selections, Big Whiskey’s is aiming to create whiskey cocktails that are approachable for the non-whiskey drinker.

Paul Sundy, Founder and Senior VP of Operations states, “When we opened our first Big Whiskey’s in 2006, I never would have imagined that 11 years later whiskey would be such a thing. We really want to make whiskey approachable beyond the trendiness of it. Whiskey is the most classic of all liquors, so let’s embrace that and not be afraid of it.”

Big Whiskey's currently boasts a menu of over 100 whiskeys and aims to educate on whiskey basics. Adding whiskey in two of the new fall drinks, the Harvest Beer and the Apple Cider Irish Mule, not only creates cocktails that taste like fall, but also makes whiskey an inviting spirit for those that might not know if they like the liquor neat or on the rocks…or even at all.

The fall-inspired drinks are available at all Big Whiskey’s locations through November 15th.",https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Apple-Cider-Irish-Mule-Fall-Cocktail.png|https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-Orchard-Martini-Fall-Cocktail.png|https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Harvest-Beer-Fall-Craft-Beer-Cocktail.png|https://bigwhiskeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-Orchard-Martini-Fall-Cocktail-1.png,2017-09-21,Drinks|News|Seasonal|Specials

11682,Big Whiskey's Bentonville Celebrates World Down Syndrome Day,"March 15, 2018, Bentonville AR — After wrapping up a celebration of Big Whiskey’s first anniversary in Bentonville on March 10th, the company is once again celebrating; this time recognizing World Down Syndrome Day with a week-long fundraiser for Down Syndrome Connection of NWA (DSCNWA). 

World Down Syndrome day is celebrated every year on March 21st because of the numbers in the date “3/21,” which represent the three copies of the 21st chromosome present in people with Down Syndrome.  The goal of the day is not just to raise awareness about the presence of Down Syndrome in our world, but also about how people with Down Syndrome can and do make meaningful contributions to society throughout their lives.

As an employer of a person with Down Syndrome, Big Whiskey’s has a special passion for helping people understand how valuable these individuals are.  “People with Down syndrome are really limited only by society’s expectations of them and the lack of opportunities afforded to them because of negative stereotypes,” says Shane Miller, owner of the Big Whiskey’s location in Bentonville.  “They can do anything if they are given the right opportunity and training.”

The Down Syndrome Connection of NWA has a mission to facilitate inclusion and respect while ensuring access to support and resources for people with Down syndrome and their families.  “Opportunities and events like the one Big Whiskey’s is hosting for World Down Syndrome Day are a benefit to our organization in many ways,” said DSCNWA board member Lincoln Keck.  “One of the most exciting aspects is to see how the programs and connections facilitated by DSCNWA in our community can be instrumental in creating opportunities for growth, development, and future employment for people with Down syndrome.  Big Whiskey’s is a great partner in bringing that to life.”

From March 14th through March 21st, Big Whiskey’s employees will ask customers to round their bills up to the next whole dollar and give their change to DSCNWA.  Then on March 21st, Big Whiskey’s will donate 10% of all sales from 5-10pm directly to the organization.  All are encouraged to come out sometime during the week to show their support for this very worthy cause!

 



Whiskey Holdings, LLC, DBA Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar is the first franchisee of Springfield, MO based Big Whiskey’s and is locally owned and operated by Bentonville residents Shane and Candice Miller.

After purchasing property on West 135th street in November of 2017, the Springfield-based restaurant brand has officially begun construction on their latest corporate location.

Slated to open in early July, the newest Big Whiskey’s location at 9100 West 135th Street will be the company’s second stand-alone restaurant. After purchasing two shuttered Ruby Tuesday’s locations in southwest Missouri in February of 2017, the first stand-alone building in Republic, Missouri, was redesigned and opened its doors for business the following August.

Company president, Austin Herschend, explains, “Opening the freestanding store in Republic, MO, was the perfect opportunity for us to really evolve our layout and the overall atmosphere of Big Whiskey’s. The restaurant itself has been a huge success, and we’re excited to introduce Overland Park to the best of Big Whiskey’s.”

As construction is underway, getting involved in the Overland Park community is a top priority. Joining the local chamber of commerce, engaging with the growing soccer community, and connecting with local groups and organizations are each segments being tackled by the Big Whiskey’s team. While creating these connections, the brand is also on the heels of launching a hiring campaign for the new location. Aiming to hire over 100 people across all areas of the restaurant, interested applicants can currently apply online at bigwhiskeys.com/apply-online/.

After recently celebrating the opening of a second Kansas City-area location in July of this year, the work continues for Big Whiskey’s as plans are well underway for the4,600 square-foot stand-alone location in Nixa.

“Many people in the community know we’ve had this property for a while. We’re excited to make it official that we will, in fact, be opening a new Big Whiskey’s location in my home town, Nixa,” announces Co-Founder and Senior VP of Operations, Paul Sundy.

Purchased in November 2016, Big Whiskey’s acquired two shuttered Ruby Tuesday’s locations in Nixa and Republic, MO. Both properties provided the brand with their first opportunity to open a free-standing location. Tackling the Republic store first, Big Whiskey’s opened its doors in August 2017.

The growing restaurant brand is targeting a December opening at 715 McCroskey Street, just in time to raise a toast to the holidays.

Sundy continues, “The southwest Missouri community has been so good to us. We’ve made a lot of friends over the last 12 years, and those friends are our biggest customers and fans. I’m really looking forward to ending 2018 with another grand opening party!”

Big Whiskey’s Nixa will be the brand’s second company-owned location to open in 2018. Construction has also started on the first of two franchise locations in Las Vegas, Nevada, with a winter 2018-2019 target opening date for the Las Vegas Boulevard spot.

19729,"New Year, New Digs","BIG WHISKEY’S DOUBLES HOME OFFICE MOVING TO OZARK, MO
On the heels of opening up the first of two contracted franchise stores in Las Vegas, Big Whiskey’s is plowing into 2019 with plenty of momentum…and a new home base. The restaurant recently moved their home office to Ozark, Missouri to accommodate the continued growth.

“Moving the office from downtown Springfield to Ozark has been pretty bittersweet for me,” states Big Whiskey’s co-founder, Paul Sundy. “I’ve spent my entire professional career working downtown, so this is a big adjustment. We outgrew our space and had a great opportunity to elevate our home office structure with the Ozark property, so it just made sense for our company.”

Big Whiskey’s newest home base is located just off of highway 65 and CC at 2120 W. Calhoun Street. The property, purchased in 2015 by Tri-Property Group, (another one of Sundy’s endeavors) is approximately 15,000 square feet. Currently, restaurant operations are occupying about 5,000sq/ft of the space, with the additional space available for lease.

“The space is set-up for us to grow into it at our own pace. Plus, the easy access to highway 65 and the central location between all our stores makes it convenient for us to host potential franchisees coming from out of town,” continues Sundy.

Tri-Property Group owns the building on Park Central East that’s home to the original Big Whiskey’s location. The vacated office space, approximately 1,950 square feet, is currently available for lease, in addition to loft space on the upper floors of the building.



Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar currently operates seven restaurants in Southwest Missouri, one location in Overland Park, KS, and two franchise locations; Bentonville, AR and Kansas City, MO. A Las Vegas Franchise is scheduled to open in February 2019.

21161,Big Whiskey's Supports Midwest Flooding Relief Efforts,"BIG WHISKEY’S COMMUNITY GIVEBACK NIGHTS SCHEDULED TO SUPPORT CONVOY OF HOPE AND MIDWEST FLOOD RELIEF
In the midst of massive flooding affecting the Midwest including areas in Missouri, Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar looks to give back, supporting relief efforts through Convoy of Hope.

“We preach this a lot, but a community first mentality is truly part of our mission and something we strive to commit to throughout the year. Several members of our Big Whiskey’s family are feeling a direct impact of the flooding happening in Missouri and Nebraska through their friends and family. We knew we wanted to help with flood support in some way,” states Big Whiskey’s director of marketing, Laura Head Elliott.

To put things in perspective, the National Weather Service Kansas City Twitter account posted, “The Missouri River is currently discharging at a rate of 315 thousand cubic feet per second in Rulo, NE (near Craig, MO). If those numbers don’t mean much to you…that’s enough water to fill Arrowhead Stadium in under 9 minutes.”

Big Whiskey’s will host four Community Giveback nights, March 25-28 at specific locations, with 10% of sales those nights being donated to Convoy of Hope and their Midwest flood relief efforts. Monday, March 25 at the Republic Road location in Springfield; Tuesday, March 26 at Battlefield Road in Springfield; Wednesday, March 27 at the location in Republic, MO; and Thursday, March 28 at the Nixa location.

Big Whiskey’s has previously partnered with Convoy of Hope, donating $10,000 from a month-long campaign following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017.

Additional information about the Midwest flood support giveback nights, including a link for direct donations to Convoy of Hope, can be found on the Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar Facebook page.

23375,Big Whiskey's Annual Fundraiser Breaks Company Record,"BIG WHISKEY’S RAISES RECORD AMOUNT FOR AMBASSADORS FOR CHILDREN
Celebrating their sixth year of hosting an annual May campaign for National Foster Care Month, Big Whiskey’s American Restaurant & Bar® presented a check to Ambassadors for Children for $12,770.40!

Doubling funds from last year’s campaign, this is the largest donation Big Whiskey’s has made to any single charitable organization since implementing their Community Giveback initiatives six years ago. New this year, a partnership with Ezra Brooks Whiskey and a new whiskey cocktail, the Watermelon Whiskey, helped to boost overall fundraising with $2.00 from every featured drink sold being donated to the campaign.

Big Whiskey’s has been an “Ambassador for Children,” since May 2014 hosting fundraising campaigns every year. Since that first year, the restaurant has raised a total of $34,195 for the local charity providing support for foster families and children in Southwest Missouri. The Big Whiskey’s location on Battlefield Road in Springfield raised the most this year of the seven corporate locations with a total of $3,269.

“Each year we are blown away with the support from Big Whiskey’s! Their commitment to Ambassadors for Children has helped us meet so many needs for kids in foster care in our community. They’ve become such a valuable partner for us and we are just so grateful,” exclaims KeKe Rover, Ambassadors for Children Director.

The theme this year for Ambassadors for Children was “I Am Me,” highlighting and encouraging children in foster care to celebrate their individual talents and identities. “We want our kids to know that being in foster care doesn’t define who they are. They are uniquely themselves,” states Rover.

Anna Messer, Big Whiskey’s Operations Manager states, “We set our goal at $10,000 this year thinking we would come close with the addition of our new location in Nixa.

29670,Raise a Glass! Newest Location Breaks Sales Records,"JEFFERSON CITY WELCOMES BIG WHISKEY'S WITH OPEN ARMS
As fall's cooler temps are gripping the air, things are heating up just a few blocks northwest of Missouri's State Capitol building. At 627 W. McCarty Street in Jefferson City, you'll find Big Whiskey's newest location. If you step out onto the patio you'll be greeted by a heatwave thanks to overhead industrial heaters that make year-round patio season a real thing.

The newest franchise addition to the Big Whiskey’s brand opened on Friday, October 18th to incredible enthusiasm in the community. The three-day opening weekend topped the previous sales record for the company by twenty-two percent. The brand, which started franchising its “American Restaurant & Bar” concept in 2015, has seen great success in previous franchise grand openings but none to this scale. A representative for JC Whiskey's LLC, the ownership group operating the Jefferson City franchise, says ""we are thrilled with the opening and see no signs of slowing down. We're ecstatic to be a part of this community.""

“An opening like that really charts the course for success. The team in Jefferson City put in the hard work and it really paid off,” affirmed Paul Sundy, co-founder of Big Whiskey’s and acting Senior Vice President of Operations. He continued, “We know our brand is special and we know our stores have the potential to become staples in the communities we’re growing into, this weekend in Jefferson City really proved that.”

Rave reviews for the newly opened American Restaurant & Bar are rolling in as Big Whiskey's quickly establishes itself as a staple in downtown Jefferson City. ""Dining at Big Whiskeys in Jefferson City was an excellent experience! The food was great, our server was exceptional, and the overall atmosphere was exactly what we needed in JC. Also, the historical photos of the building was a great addition and something everyone should go check out! I will definitely be back!"", states one reviewer.


Another diner said of the new downtown hotspot, ""I loved the food! I went with 5 people and all said it was great. Service was good despite how busy it was. The building itself was really cool. I would definitely recommend it!""

In addition to the year-round patio, Big Whiskey's boasts a large bar area lined with huge TVs perfect for sports fans looking to watch the big game. While the restaurant features a robust bar, it is in perfect balance with a huge dining space suited for a family night out. A BW signature ""Flag Room"", a large private dining area apt for hosting parties, completes the restaurant.

Along with a wide-ranging whiskey selection, Big Whiskey’s boasts an extensive menu featuring bold, flavorful plates and great choices for lunch, dinner, happy hour and late-night. A rotating seasonal menu compliments the brand’s staple items that include: Buffalo Chicken Wontons, crispy fried wontons filled with Big Whiskey’s Buffalo Chicken Dip; the mouthwatering Big Whiskey BBQ Craft Burger, topped with crispy onion rings, bacon and homemade Honey Whiskey BBQ sauce; and a selection of hand-cut steaks and homemade pasta dishes.
